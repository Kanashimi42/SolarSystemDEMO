﻿/*
 *           ~~ Screenshot Utility ~~ 
 *  Takes a screenshot of the game window with its
 *  current resolution.
 * 
 *  Notes:
 *    - Images are stored in a Screenshots folder within the Unity project directory.
 * 
 *    - Images will copied over if player prefs are reset!
 * 
 *    - ScaleFactor - If the resolution is 1024x768, and the scale factor
 *      is 2, the screenshot will be saved as 2048x1536.
 * 
 *    - The mouse is not captured in the screenshot.
